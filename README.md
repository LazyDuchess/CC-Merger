Sims 2 package merger

This simple little program allows you to merge Sims 2 package files into fewer ones. This was previously thought not possible!

You need the Delimon.Win32.IO library to build this, since it removes the file path length limitation the original IO libraries have: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/DelimonWin32IO-Library-V40-7ff6b16c

Uses https://github.com/aybe/Windows-API-Code-Pack-1.1 for the taskbar progress bar.

The package code and some other file format bits are modified from https://github.com/riperiperi/FreeSO
